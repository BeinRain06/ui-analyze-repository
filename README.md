## ANALYZE UI-APPROACH WEB DESIGN

This particular repository aims to enhance rapid growth on your wen's design skill. Minimalist website as **personal-blog** will stand as useful gardening hints to start choosing **minimalistic** `color` and `typography` for your going-on board project. As you analyzed others types of websites as well as personal blog website for better branding of yourself learn :

### 1. To recognize the design principles displayed

(layout organization, typography, contrast, color, alignment, ...)

### 2. Pass the Design to Filter and critical analysis

What's going on with what you have just learned and what you currently know of these principles. Is it the right way to make it shine or is there any other way to have done it? What keep challenges my understanding on these principles ? How to start applying them effectively in my own project ? How to keep these principles organized in my mind ?

### 3. Moods Expression coming out of the Design

Originally chosen colors on the design express special feeling through users reaching the website. Pull out what's the driven mood conveyed by the author of these websites design to their interest's audience.

### 4. Analyzed available informations provided

Analyze available informations provided others than just the design. The informations that turns a personal website into a **business**, an **offer**, a **products services**. Tackle solid foundation about selling products online.

### 5. Go Over And Over Again through the se **DESIGN**

Don't rush yourself, do the process again and again , even if it is for a single website. One mastering can make you presume with certainty how all works in terms of designing minimal website. Because you want to start small and learn through it. ONCE AGAIN!! Don't rush yourself, go over and over again through the same **DESIGN** until you're enough comfortable to understand it (even teaching someone els what's going on on there).

### 6. Root what you learn as Memory and Teaching

**Michael Lim** just said in one of his blog post [The Most Profitable One-Person Business Models In 2025](https://medium.com/practice-in-public/the-most-profitable-one-person-business-models-in-2025-f19bf5846621) on **medium.com** :
"When you solve a problem for yourself, it’s called self-improvement. When you solve a problem for others, it’s called business.". And this reasonably resonates with me. We are all in mess in something, the good way to stand out of it is to start sorting mess related to us that others also experience. **Document your web design analysis** and **share it with others**, while applying your just learned new knowledge to project you are eventually dealing with or further prioritize one you will gain to start in a near future, and even in real life experience.

**That's what is in. Go for It! And become a better Designer.**
